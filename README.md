# Student Performance Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict student academic performance based on multiple academic and demographic factors. The goal is to identify patterns that can help educators support students more effectively.



## Problem Statement
Student academic performance is influenced by various factors such as study time, attendance, family background, and previous grades. Early prediction of student performance can help schools provide timely interventions.



## Methodology
1. Data is collected from an educational dataset.
2. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed.
3. Important features are selected for modeling.
4. A machine learning model is trained to predict student performance.
5. Model accuracy is evaluated using error metrics.



## Usage
1. Upload the dataset to Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells in order.
3. Train the machine learning model.
4. Generate predictions for student performance.
5. Analyze the results to support educational decisions.
